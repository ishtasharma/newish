Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting digital systems, networks, and sensitive data from cyber threats such as hacking, malware, and phishing. It plays a vital role in ensuring privacy, preventing unauthorized access, and maintaining trust in online environments. By employing measures like firewalls, encryption, and secure authentication protocols, cybersecurity helps defend against potential attacks and data breaches. As technology evolves and cybercriminals become more sophisticated, the need for robust and proactive cybersecurity strategies has grown, making it an essential component of our connected world.
